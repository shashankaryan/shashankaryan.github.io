Volunteering in a conference is one of the essential contribution in the community. And this time, it gonna happen at New Delhi itself, so it was our turn to make it.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-151" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-19-16.jpg?w=529" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-19-16" width="1200" height="900" />

<strong>Preparation Phase:</strong><img class="  wp-image-155 alignright" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-19-29.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-19-29" width="236" height="315" />

Preparation of a national conference is a very sensitive and tedious =thing to accomplish, and PyCon was happening for the very first time in New Delhi so, much more responsibilities to take care of was on us. The venue was JNU Convention Center, all the volunteers were continuously meeting at some place in the campus itself. We also have to handle the python express workshops going across our city. Finally, I got a responsible work along with @cosmologist_10 to handle all the proceedings for the PyCon Workshops. We were supposed to connect with each and every person (speakers, volunteers, attendees) related to workshop <img class="  wp-image-166 alignright" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-20-13.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-20-13" width="237" height="316" />and go through every needed requirements for those.During this, I learned how to mail officially and communicate over the mail. We worked with full enthusiasm and completed our almost work before time and got reply from almost every speakers and only one problem we faced was to catch a speaker, as her details were nowhere available. It was bit difficult also as, no mistakes are acceptable. We also have to install and try each and every software on our laptops, so got to learn about various new technologies. Finally, after all the setups done, I left for the campus, for helping out as much as possible. I made new friends from PyDelhi itself, during this phase. I was all fun to work along with PyDelhi. I along with my mates and juniors accommodated nearby hotel so that we could reach JNU as early as possible.

<strong>The Workshop Day:</strong>

<img class="  wp-image-183 alignright" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-26-35.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-26-35" width="269" height="201" />

It was 23rd September, 2016, the first day of PyCon India, 2016 and most importantly my day as I have worked very hard to make this day successful. I woke up very early by

5 in the morning and awoke rest people with me and got ready to reach the venue. I booked a cab and tweeted with a huge smile and a lot of excitement inside me "Good  morning Delhi. It's #pyconindia day - The Workshops." and reached the venue by 7 am.

<img class="  wp-image-135 alignright" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/1.jpg?w=680" alt="1" width="233" height="174" />

As I reached, I got all the further details and started tracking all the speakers for the day, so that they could reach the venue by time. And just in the morning, I saw Andy (@amuellerml) was coming, it was awesome the see the 2nd keynote speaker for whom i was waiting eagerly. We had introductory conversations and discussed other technical stuffs also. After that we had breakfast together and got pictures with him. Now, it was 10 and the workshops were to be started, all the volunteers and <img class="  wp-image-154 alignright" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-19-25.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-19-25" width="231" height="230" />speaker reached and sessions started  in all the Audi and lecture halls. The session chair introduced speaker and session started. In morning phase, all the workshops were going smoothly. The JetBrains Team arrived and we took a cool welcome selfie with Paul Everitt and Dimitry. Soon the morning session came to end successfully and we proceeded for the lunch, food was very much delicious and I tried all the varieties over there. I also met PyPune team, RedHat guys, they were very awesome and helpful. It was seeming that we all know each other since a long time and are good friends. It was 2pm and afternoon workshop sessions had to be started, in this session i<img class="  wp-image-147 alignright" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-19-03.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-19-03" width="249" height="186" /> was volunteering also in PyCharm workshop by Paul Everitt. Soon the evening session started and went on smoothly, some problems were also faced regarding the network connections, but the workshop ended successfully by 5. My day was all successful, thanks to @vkrathi and @cosmologist_10 for helping and working together. This day taught me various thing about how to manage and handle an event, how to <img class="  wp-image-153 alignright" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-19-22.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-19-22" width="280" height="209" />interact with the speakers and attendees, how to make speaker comfortable to give his best over the session and most important i made a lot of friends from my PyDelhi community. It was an awesome feeling for me to talk fluently without hesitation and express my things to all the other  people present over there. After that, we had a volunteers meet in which discussions about how to make the further days of event much more interesting and comfortable and overcome the mistakes for the future. Soon we took a lot of selfies with all the volunteers and Andy. We all were going crazy and enjoyed a lot our very first day of the event. After that, I along with my mates went for dinner, had food and then left for hotel to rest and come back the next morning for '<strong>The Conference Day</strong>'.

<strong>Conference Day - 1:</strong>

<img class="  wp-image-140 alignright" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_21-52-17.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_21-52-17" width="322" height="241" />

And I left for the JNU campus by tweeting 'Good Morning Delhi!, Its Conference Day-1'. and reached by 7am. The biggest initial challenge for the day was registration as thousand of people were to come, and have done all the preparation for that so that it could go smoothly. It started by 8am and rush came in with excitement in the eyes of every attendee. After the breakfast, it was time for the commencement of the conference, Anuvrat Parashar (@bhanuvrat) took the session chair and then the event started  with full enthusiasm and excitement of the keynotes.

<img class="alignnone  wp-image-157" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-19-37.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-19-37" width="691" height="518" /><img class="  wp-image-160 alignright" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-19-49.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-19-49" width="321" height="241" />

The first session was the K.G. Award distribution, and PSSI president, Anand B Pillai was introduced to the dice and a huge round of applause filled the whole auditorium. Dr. Ajith Kumar B.P. , the award winner was welcomed to the stage for taking this prestigious award. Now, it was time to encourage and congratulate all the Python Express volunteers and tutors for taking 88 workshops across the country and<img class="  wp-image-148 alignright" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-19-06.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-19-06" width="325" height="244" /> introduced 5000 new students to the language. I was also one of the volunteer and it was for the very first time in my life that I had ever been to the stage of any platform, it was pleasure moment for me to see that audience were clapping for us and the project Python Express gone much more successful this year. It was a hounour for all of us to be on the stage and getting congratulated by all the pythonistas across the venue.

Now the most awaited moment of the <strong><img class="  wp-image-152 alignright" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-19-19.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-19-19" width="308" height="231" /></strong>conference  was going to be started, it was the 1st Keynote By <strong>Baishampayan Ghose (B.G.), CTO of Helpshift. </strong>It was one of the most motivational session i have ever had in my life. In his session, B.G. shared the very real and actual situation that happens in every persons life by the very simple and polite example of Wall  and Bridges. It is very real that we dream of making bridge but restrict ourselves in making the wall more beautiful only, and never be able to build a bridge. Hence, this motivational session came to an end and the talks were to be started at various halls. There were dev-sprints and open<img class="  wp-image-159 alignright" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-19-44.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-19-44" width="202" height="269" /> spaces also going on where different people were attending and enjoying over there. It was 1pm and lunch started,  <img class="  wp-image-138 alignright" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/ctl2y__vuaasm_tlarge.jpg?w=680" alt="ctl2y__vuaasm_t-jpglarge" width="248" height="186" />there was a huge line but still I got the food soon, it was so much tasty and ended it as I had to explore more people. Then I had a conversation with B.G. , he is one of the most tremendous guys I have ever seen. He was very much frank and shared his own story , I also discussed my own project with him to get some suggestions and he gave me some like 'Baap Ko Pakro'.

Finally I had the first interaction with Anand (PSSI President), I went to him and handshaked with I'm Shashank, he replied, Oh! the one who tweets a lot. I said yes. Then we had a lot of discussions, soon my mate Shweta also joined us and he was quite much impressed by us. It was an honor that such a big personality was appreciating and encouraging us after we discussed our project with him. He introduced us to Dr. Ajith also regarding our project.

There was a meeting also of the Python Express guys to make it much more vibrant and fruitful. A lot suggestions came around to look upon and make it better. Soon the T-shirts were distributed, I also got one, it was a very cool t-shirt.<img class="  wp-image-143 alignright" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-18-45.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-18-45" width="260" height="249" />

Now its time for the 2nd keynote of the day  by the <strong>open source lawyer</strong> - <strong>Van Lindberg. </strong>It was a very taughtful session to have over the software engineering. I learned a lot and got to know about various new facts.  Soon the day ended with charm and it was time for the PyCon Party.

We all the volunteers and speakers reached the Barbeque Nation for the Python Party, near Vasant Kunj in Delhi. It was all fun and excitement. Enjoyment was on its peak. I am a bit unable to explain the scenario in words, i think the pictures will define it in the best way.

Being in between the two keynotes was a wonderful feeling for me as it was one of the best shot of me for this PyCon. Everyone was in the jolly mood and we were going crazy in taking photos. The party went hard, we took a lot of photos and the whole season was going pythonic at Barbeque Nation. The party was over by 9pm and we headed toward the hotel as we have to be back for the day-2 and also the last day of the conference.

<strong>Conference Day-2:</strong>

The last morning for the PyCon India, 2016 -<img class="  wp-image-144 alignright" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-18-53.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-18-53" width="314" height="267" /> Conference Day-2 , as usual the day started with the tweet and we headed towards the JNU after checking out the hotel. It was very much exciting as the awaited keynote was going to be delivered by my favourite <strong>Andreas Mueller (@amuellerml). T</strong>he keynote get started after the breakfast, it was the technical keynote of this PyCon about the trending machine learning era and its productive use on various small or big applications. As I am going to work on this field, it was very much helpful. I was also unable to understand all the things but yet a long way to go for me. So I decided to do it first by myself then discuss the things.

The day also given me to be a part of annual dgplug staircase meet. Lots of discussions took place over there about how to start open source contribution, how to get connected to the people of your domain, how to connect over IRC,how to make dgplug much more comfortable and much more. Kushal, Sayan, Farhan, and others share their views about what motivates them to contribute to open source and why they use to do it.  <img class="alignnone  wp-image-185" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-26-42.jpg" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-26-42" width="674" height="674" /><img class="  wp-image-158 alignright" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-19-41.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-19-41" width="339" height="191" />

The dev-sprints and open spaces was also going awesome. PyLadies community of Pune was also trending for the girl enthusiasts. Other community like Outreachy was also there who shared a lot of things to do in FOSS world. I was very much happy that people who are working hard are getting worth for it also.

<img class="alignnone  wp-image-164" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-20-05.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-20-05" width="250" height="187" /><img class="  wp-image-162 alignnone" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-19-57.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-19-57" width="197" height="197" />

Now it was 3 pm and every one at the venue was eager to know about the t-shirts of PyCon. Already all of them were filled their pockets by lots of laptop stickers and batches. I also got a tee, lots of stickers, a key chain, batches and much more. The t-shirt distribution started by 3:30pm. A very long queue was formed to get it, somehow volunteers managed in a very great way that every participant got a t-shirt and leave the venue with a smile. Since, morning I  had attended many talks, all of them very quite interesting and technologically advanced. All the sponsors got their t-shirts on their respective booths. After the tees were distributed, almost major crowd left the campus. At last I met one of the speaker who was from same domain as me and we discussed the things.  After that, I and my mate had a coffee with Anand and took photos also. He was very much helpful for us in the entire conference. Now the last moments was going thorough and we had a thank you note session in Audi-1.

<img class="alignnone  wp-image-172" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-20-34.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-20-34" width="683" height="512" />

<strong>Thank You Note:</strong>

<img class="alignnone  wp-image-150" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-19-13.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-19-13" width="680" height="510" />

All the volunteers, speakers and attendees gathered and stated the thank you quotes to all the participants, volunteer and speakers. Anand congratulated all of us for leading a successful PyCon India 2016. We asked for suggestions to audience in order to make PyCon much more effective and efficient, all the good and bad points have been noted down by the organizing committee. After all of this, we had a cool photography session with all the volunteers across the country were on the stage getting appreciation from the audience. Whole hall was surrounded by a huge and unstoppable round of applause.

<img class="  wp-image-186 aligncenter" src="https://shashankaryaan.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/photo_2016-09-26_22-46-27.jpg?w=680" alt="photo_2016-09-26_22-46-27" width="803" height="450" />

My opinion based on my experience is that PyCon was like a family for me, whole 3 days throughout along with the preparation days to end of the event, everyone worked together with lot of co-ordination and enthusiasm, some hurdles came across but that all happens. Most importantly I learned lots of things like how to speak fluently with the strangers , how to take part in an effective discussion, how to approach someone, how to do formal mails, how to tweet, how to manage things at its best, how to work as a part of community, importance of having a community, got personally connected with most of the speakers and also got some internship opportunities, to prepare for. I loved this PyCon a lot as it sparked a new energy and direction for my life. I wish that i could be able to pace up and grow. I want to thank Anuvrat a lot for encouraging, helping and trusting me for this event. I hope that i wolud grow much more technically before the next PyCon. Thanks to PyDelhi, Akshay, Anuvrat, Vipin-wokshop lead, Shweta-my mate, all the speakers, PyPune, ChennaiPy, Bangpypers, all the volunteers and attendees to helping out to make PyCon India 2016 successful and memorable forever. Thanks a lot.
